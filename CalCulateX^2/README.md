# Tensorflow

Tensorflow is a strong library to learn machine learning because so many option that you can do with it, make model, prediction, calculate and many thing, so in this code example i have code that machine can predict the output from (y = x^2 + 2x + 1)  this formula, and first of all  again i'm tell this is all machine do, not from user / human tto give a good output

## The Code

## Import Tensorflow.js 

```javaScript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');
```

- This line imports the TensorFlow.js library, enabling the use of its functions and classes. TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.

## Define the Polynomial Regression Function

```javaScript
async function polynomialRegression() {
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

- We define an asynchronous function, 'polynomialRegression', because some operations in TensorFlow.js are asynchronous (like model training) and return Promises.

## Create the model

```javaScript
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4, inputShape: [1], activation: 'relu'}));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1}));
```

- 'tf.sequential()' initializes a new sequential model. A sequential model is a linear stack of layers.
- 'model.add()' adds layers to the model.
- The first layer added is a dense (fully connected) layer with 4 units (neurons) and uses the ReLU activation function. The 'inputShape' is set to '[1]', indicating that the input to this layer is 1-dimensional.
- The second layer is another dense layer with 1 unit. This layer is the output layer and will output the predicted value.

## Compile the model

## Compile The model

```javaScript
model.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd'});
```

- 'model.compile()' prepares the model for training.
- The loss function is set to 'meanSquaredError', which is commonly used for regression problems. It measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
- The optimizer 'sgd' stands for stochastic gradient descent, an algorithm that's used to minimize the loss function.

## Generate Synthetic Training Data

```javaScript
const xs = tf.tensor1d([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
const ys = tf.tensor1d(xs.dataSync().map(x => x**2 + 2*x + 1));
```

- 'tf.tensor1d()' creates a one-dimensional tensor from an array of numbers.
- 'xs' contains the input values.
- 'ys' contains the output values, calculated using a quadratic equation ('y = x^2 + 2x + 1'). This simulates a real-world scenario where we have known input-output pairs for training.

## Train the Model

```javaScript
await model.fit(xs.reshape([10, 1]), ys.reshape([10, 1]), {epochs: 200});
```

- 'model.fit()' is used to train the model.
- 'xs.reshape([10, 1])' and 'ys.reshape([10, 1])' convert the input and output tensors into a shape that TensorFlow.js can work with for training. Here, it reshapes them to be 2D tensors with 10 rows and 1 column.
- The model is trained over 200 epochs. An epoch is one cycle through the full training dataset.

## Use the model Prediction

```javaScript
const output = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([10], [1, 1]));
output.print();
```

- After training, 'model.predict()' is used to make predictions based on new data that the model hasn't seen before.
- Here, it predicts the output for 'x = 10'.
- 'output.print()' prints the predicted value to the console.

## Execute the Function

```javaScript
polynomialRegression();
```

- Finally, the 'polynomialRegression' function is called to execute all the above steps.

## Summary
This script demonstrates how to set up a simple neural network for polynomial regression using TensorFlow.js. It covers creating a model, adding layers, compiling the model, generating synthetic data for training, training the model, and making predictions with the trained model. The script is a complete example of using TensorFlow.js for a basic machine learning task.
